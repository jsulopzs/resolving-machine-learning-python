# Resolving Python for Data Visualization

This repository contains the exercises you'll work during the course "Resolving Python for Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn".

You may use the exercises to practice on your own; challenges, datasets and solutions are provided.

Within every folder, you will find 2 types of Jupyter Notebooks:

- A: Blank notebook to be completed after you watch the respective tutorial of the [digital course](https://courses.resolvingpython.com/).
- C: Blank notebook to be completed as a homework.
- B & D files are the solutions to notebooks A & C, respectively.

❌ If you copy-paste the solutions, you will not learn anything.

✅ **It is very important you work on the notebooks as we explain in the [digital course](https://courses.resolvingpython.com/) to acquire the mental models and the skills you will use in any other data project.**

If you want to showcase your work on this course as a portfolio, don't forget to [fork this repository](https://github.com/jsulopzs/course-resolving-python-data-visualization/fork) to create a copy on your profile.
